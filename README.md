# 2020
- Jigsaw Solver as Final Year College project
	- 1st step - Capture a full image of a scrambled jigsaw puzzle 
	- 2nd step - Extract all jigsaw pieces from the puzzle and filter out junk noises 
	- 3rd step - Apply enhancement algorithms that characterize our jigsaw pieces 
	- 4th step - Matching, find any two pieces that have the best fit 
	- 5th step - Combinatorial, seeing if the whole picture is solved, if not backtrack
