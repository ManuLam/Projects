Folder Information
backups		- Two backups of the current index.html from prev stages
css		- Design
images		- Storing all images
js		- Used for all annotations
shared		- Used for Comment Feed
index.html	- MAIN Webpage for testing annotations

Most to all of the code is within index.html
F:\project\public\js\annotator\taggings is the other place where I worked heavily on

What I have achieved:
Annotate an image
Different colour annotations
Tagging within annotations('Enter' key for instant display of tags)
Comment Feed for every Annotation (Mouse over the annotation, type the text then hit 'Enter' key)
Fancy selector when dragging annotation
Simple annotation of text
A simple grouping concept with checkboxes
Data can be stored to our mongoDB (Needs to be set up again)
Data gathered within an area within the page
