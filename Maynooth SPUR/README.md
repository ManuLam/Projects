Summer Programme for Undergraduate Researchers

Project Title:
  Exploring and Visualising VR Gaming Behaviour in 3D Menus

Proposed Project Details
  Virtual Reality (VR) allows people to explore and interact with simulated environments,
  objects and situations previously unimaginable. Despite the growing availability of
  games, applications and experiences, there is little known about how these new 3D
  environments potentially differ from their previous 2D counterparts.
  The research team behind this SPUR project consists of Dr. Ralf Bierig (Maynooth
  University; the mentor) and Dr. Damien MacNamara (VR Fury, Limerick; external
  collaborator for some meetings). The team has previously collected a rich data set of
  VR game behaviour from people without previous VR experience. This data will permit
  studying how people naturally interact with complex 3D menu systems.
  The student will work with the team to transcribe, process and analyse a
  comprehensive VR data set and derive informative behavioural insights. In particular,
  this will include overviews about user actions (e.g. their activities with 3D menus, 3D
  menu items and controllers), learning and VR problem solving. The student will use data
  analytical programming languages (e.g. R or Python) and tools (e.g. R Studio, Weka,
  RapidMiner) to process and analyse data and apply suitable libraries to generate
  insightful visualisations (e.g. via ggplot2) of findings.
